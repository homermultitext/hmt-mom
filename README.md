# Homer Multitext project: Mandatory Ongoing Maintenance (HMT-MOM): work in 2017



HMT MOM is a library to support editorial work on the Homer Muiltitext project.  It is used by the `mom.sc` script included in the [template files for HMT editors](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-editors-template).


In 2017-2018, we are migrating to a new technical infrastructure (to be published as version 2.0 of HMT MOM).


Current documentation is being published on HMT github at <https://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-mom/>

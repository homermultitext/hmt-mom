# HMT-MOM

Homer Multitext project: Mandatory Ongoing Maintenance.

Although HMT MOM can be installed and used on any system with git, gradle and the
Homer Multitext project's [fork of the Perseus morphological parser][morph], 
MOM is primarily intended for use from within 
the [Homer Multitext project virtual machine for editors][vm].

Detailed documentation on how to use MOM in editing material for the Homer Multitext
project is being added to the project web site's [guides for editors and contributors][2].

See the [project wiki][1] for draft documentation,
and discussion of future developemnt plans.

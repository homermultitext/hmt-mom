# Homer Multitext project: Mandatory Ongoing Maintenance (HMT-MOM): work in 2017



HMT MOM is a library to support editorial work on the Homer Muiltitext project.  It is used by the `mom.sc` script included in the [template files for HMT editors](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-editors-template).


In 2017, we are migrating to a new technical infrastructure (to be published as version 2.0 of HMT MOM).  More information will be linked here when version 2.0 is released.

Information in the [project wiki][1] does not yet reflect version 2.0.

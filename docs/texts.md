Editions of the HMT project are *canonically citable*, and follow an explicit *model of text contents*.

The [HMT Editor's Guide](https://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-editors-guide/) explains how to encode that model using TEI-compliant XML.

The [`hmt-textmodel` library](https://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-textmodel/)  implements the same model in the Scala language.

HMT-MOM uses the `hmt-textmodel` library to validate XML against the HMT project standards.
